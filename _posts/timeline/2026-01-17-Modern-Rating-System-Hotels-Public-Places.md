Traditional reviews are outdated. In 2026, a "good" venue isn't just about food or decor; it’s about **seamless integration into a digital and inclusive lifestyle.** This new framework evaluates the complete customer journey across 5 vital pillars.

---

### 1. Digital & Payment Infrastructure
* **Connectivity:** 5G signal strength and secure, high-speed WiFi (Mbps).
* **Payments:** Full support for UPI, cards, and contactless. 
* **Privacy:** Capability to transact without mandatory mobile number sharing.

### 2. Hygiene & Facilities
* **Sanitation:** Strategic handwash stations (not just in restrooms) and automatic soap/sanitizer.
* **Water:** Access to complimentary filtered water vs. paid bottled options.
* **Restrooms:** Rated on odor control, wheelchair accessibility, and maintenance frequency.

### 3. Food & Menu Intelligence
* **Transparency:** Allergen markers and standardized **Spice Ratings** (Mild to Extra Hot).
* **Format:** Choice between physical menus and QR codes with high-quality photos.

### 4. Logistics & Environment
* **Parking & EVs:** Dedicated spots for 2/4 wheelers and availability of fast-charging EV points.
* **Acoustics:** A 1–10 noise scale (Library-quiet to Club-loud) to gauge conversation-friendliness.
* **Aesthetics:** "Peak Aesthetic Hours" (e.g., Golden Hour) for photography-focused visits.

### 5. Accessibility & Service Quality
* **Universal Design:** Ramps, elevators, and senior-citizen-friendly seating.
* **Proactive Service:** Automatic plate changes and response times under 5 minutes.
* **Booking:** Incentives for direct booking over third-party apps.

### The Weighted Rating Scale
To ensure accuracy, the final score is calculated as follows:

| Category                       | Weight |
| :----------------------------- | :----- |
| Core Service (Food/Stay)       | 30%    |
| Hygiene & Safety               | 20%    |
| Accessibility & Facilities     | 20%    |
| Service Quality                | 15%    |
| Connectivity & Payment         | 10%    |
| Amenities (Pet-friendly, etc.) | 5%     |

### Why It Matters
This system moves from subjective "vibes" to **objective utility.** It helps businesses identify service gaps and empowers customers to find spaces that meet their specific functional needs—whether that’s a quiet place to work or a reliable EV charging spot.
