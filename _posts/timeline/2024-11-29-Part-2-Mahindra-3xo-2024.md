## Pre Delivery Inspection 

The Dealer clearly told that there are no third party inspections allowed , so made a checklist and checked everything in detail as i could

### Observations 

1. (Will check with Mahindra if something can be done about it  )One Major thing that i checked and noticed that time and thought it was a software thing later found it was a hardware issue the down click of seek button in steering button is faulty.
2. All the back Headlights corners are brushed off during fitting and factory handling
3. The body panel gaps in front were good but at the back are misaligned in the left part of car and in every 3xO in stockyard
4. The plastic edges in inner door panels as well as rubber seals around gate and window could have better quality and finish




## Taking Delivery

Despite the minor observations noted during the PDI, I decided to proceed with the delivery as these were acceptable quality issues that could be addressed later. The excitement of finally getting my first car outweighed the minor imperfections.

The delivery process was smooth, with the dealership team explaining all the features and controls. They provided a comprehensive walkthrough of the vehicle's technology, safety features, and maintenance schedule.

### First Impressions

Driving the 3xO out of the dealership was an amazing feeling. The automatic transmission made navigating through Bangalore traffic much easier than expected. The cabin insulation and NVH levels that I had experienced during the test drives remained impressive even during the initial ownership days.

The high-speed stability and ground clearance proved their worth immediately on Bangalore's challenging roads. The car handled potholes and uneven surfaces with confidence, making the daily commute more comfortable.

### Initial Ownership Experience

The first few weeks with the vehicle have been positive overall. The safety features and automatic transmission that were part of my key requirements have lived up to expectations. The headroom space for my 6'1" height is comfortable in all seats, making it suitable for both daily commuting and longer road trips.

The only niggling issue has been the faulty down click of the seek button on the steering wheel, which I plan to get addressed at the first service appointment.
